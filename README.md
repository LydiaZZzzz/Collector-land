## üìå Progress Log

| Date  | Progress                                                                 |
| 4.18 | Completed the planned information architecture, including user flows and core page structure. Initiated homepage development ahead of schedule using Streamlit. Created initial file and folder organization (`static/`, `webhomepage.py`, `requirements.txt`). Implemented a top navigation bar with fixed positioning and clickable buttons. Designed and overlaid interactive product hover dots on a visual banner. Documented setup instructions and development status clearly in `README.md`.                                                                                              |
| 5.2  | Finished development of three key interfaces: `home.html`, `search.html`, and `product-detail.html`. Implemented a functional search bar on the homepage that navigates to the product pop-up. Built a product pop-up window with two working buttons: one for reshuffling products and one for returning to the homepage. Completed the product detail page layout, including a large image display and three-view switching feature. Also wrote an initial test file (`product-detail.test.js`) and resolved git push errors by submitting code via a protected-branch pull request from `dev`. |
| Next | Planned for 5.9: Start character page development and integrate favorite toggling logic. Improve UI feedback (e.g. loading animations) and apply initial usability fixes based on internal testing.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
